<h2>
    There is no certain information about the origin of the name Oulu
</h2>
<p>
    It is a likely alternative is considered to be the
    connection of the name to the the Sámi language , preserved in Finnish dialects and possibly inherited from word
    oulu , which means flooding water ( åulo 'melted snow', åulot 'melt'). It is also possible that the name Oulu would
    refer to the word uula, known in the dialects of Pohjois-Savo , which means a channel or riverbed. Very often in the
    Finnish language tradition, both the lake and the flowing river are named in the same way. Thus, also after
    Oulujärvi , the lower river was named Oulujoki and the market place born at the mouth of the river was named Oulu.
    [9] The name must have been given in the 10th–12th centuries at the latest. The oldest historical records of the
    name are from 1327–1328 Vlu, Wlw and Wlvthraesk, but certainly the name is perhaps several hundred years older than
    this.
